The puprose of this c++ library is to perform the tracking for the GEM detectors, primarily for SBS.
It is originally adapted from the original [Hall A TreeSearch library](https://github.com/JeffersonLab/TreeSearch/tree/sbs).

A more robust -and faster- GEM analysis in high background will rely on an early association of the signals in the two projections of the GEM chamber, 
and on earlier restriction of the search region, which motivates spinning out a new library.
